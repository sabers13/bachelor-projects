# Code: Nested Summation Calculator

## Description
This program calculates a nested summation based on two input integers, `n` and `m`. The computation involves a series of mathematical operations over two nested loops.

## How It Works
1. The program reads two integers:
   - `n`: Upper limit for the inner loop.
   - `m`: Upper limit for the outer loop.
2. It iterates over a range of values:
   - Outer loop iterates from `-10` to `m`.
   - Inner loop iterates from `1` to `n`.
3. For each combination of indices `i` and `j`:
   - Computes ((i + j)^3) / (j^2).
   - Accumulates the results into a temporary variable `s` for the inner loop.
4. The result from the inner loop is added to a total `sum` for the outer loop.
5. The program outputs the total summation value.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   g++ -o nested_summation nested_summation.cpp
2. Run the compiled program:
   ./nested_summation
3. Enter two integers (`n` and `m`) as inputs.
4. Observe the computed summation value as the output.
