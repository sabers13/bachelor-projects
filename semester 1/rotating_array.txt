# Code: Rotating Array Elements

## Description
This program performs a circular rotation of elements in a 1D array of size 100. The number of rotations is specified by the user, and the program outputs the resulting array in a formatted 10x10 matrix.

## How It Works
1. **Input**:
   - The number of rotations `b`.
   - An array `n[100]` containing 100 integers.
2. **Rotation Logic**:
   - The effective number of rotations is calculated as `b % 100`.
   - For each rotation:
     - The first element is moved to the end of the array, and all elements are shifted one position to the left.
3. **Output**:
   - The final rotated array is displayed as a 10x10 matrix.

## Example Usage
### Input:
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... (up to 100)
### Output:
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3
... (rest of the rotated array)
