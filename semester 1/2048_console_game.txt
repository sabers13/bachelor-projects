# Code: 2048 Console Game

## Description
This program implements a text-based version of the popular **2048 game** in the console. Players combine tiles to reach a value of 2048 while moving the tiles in different directions on a 4x4 board.

## How It Works
1. **Main Menu**:
   - Offers the following options:
     - Start the game.
     - View credits.
     - View past game records (stored in `records.txt`).
     - Exit the game.
   - Players enter their name when starting the game.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - **Controls**:
     - Move tiles using `L`, `R`, `U`, or `D` (left, right, up, down).
     - Exit the game using `E`.
   - **Gameplay**:
     - Tiles move and combine when adjacent tiles have the same value.
     - After each move, a new tile with the value 2 appears randomly on the board.
   - **Winning and Losing**:
     - Win: Reach a tile with the value **2048**.
     - Lose: No valid moves remain.

3. **Score**:
   - Score is updated based on the sum of all tile values on the board.

4. **Records**:
   - The playerâ€™s name and final score are saved in `records.txt` after each game.

5. **Rendering**:
   - The game board is displayed as a grid of tiles, with empty spaces shown as `[    ]` and tiles displayed with their respective values.
