# Code: Next Prime Matching Digit Sum

## Description
This program identifies the first prime number greater than a given integer `n` whose digit sum matches the digit sum of `n`.

## How It Works
1. The program reads an integer `n`.
2. It calculates the digit sum of `n`:
   - Iteratively sums the digits of `n` until the full number is processed.
3. Starting from `n+1`, it checks successive integers to find the next prime number:
   - For each number, it verifies primality by ensuring it is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself (exclusive).
   - If a number is prime, it calculates its digit sum.
   - It compares the digit sum of the prime number to the digit sum of `n`.
   - If the digit sums match, the program outputs the number.
4. Outputs the result and ends.

## Example Usage
### Input:
10
### Output:
11

### Input:
28
### Output:
37

## File Information
- **Filename**: `next_prime_matching_sum.cpp`
- **Language**: C++
- **Dependencies**: Standard C++ library (`iostream`).

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   g++ -o next_prime_matching_sum next_prime_matching_sum.cpp
2. Run the compiled program:
   ./next_prime_matching_sum
3. Enter an integer `n` as input.
4. Observe the result, which will be the next prime number matching the digit sum of `n`.
