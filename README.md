## Highlighted Projects

### 2D Fighter Game (Semester 3)
**Technologies:** Java, AWT/Swing  
**Concepts:** OOP design, collision detection, real-time input handling  

**Description:**  
A 2D fighter game featuring two-player combat with animations, health bars, and smooth controls. This project was pivotal in solidifying my OOP skills and introducing event-driven programming. It displays a clear understanding of game loops, state management, and real-time rendering.

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented player inputs, attacks, and physics-based movement.
- Designed a modular structure allowing easy addition of new moves or characters.
- Gained experience in handling concurrency and user events for responsive gameplay.

### Hex Game with AI (Alpha-Beta Pruning) (Semester 5)
**Technologies:** Python, Pygame  
**Concepts:** Minimax search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, heuristic evaluation, game theory  

**Description:**  
A strategic Hex board game pitting the player against an AI opponent. The AI leverages Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves under computational constraints. Through this project, I learned to formalize game states, define evaluation functions, and prune the search space efficiently.

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve decision-making speed.
- Developed a heuristic evaluation function that rewards strong board positioning.
- Showcased the ability to combine algorithmic logic with intuitive game design.

### Library Management System (Semester 7)
**Technologies:** Python, Microsoft SQL Server  
**Concepts:** Database schema design, SQL queries, CRUD operations, role-based access control, error handling  

**Description:**  
A comprehensive application that manages users, subscriptions, book inventories, and transactions. This system underscores my proficiency in database design and integration using Microsoft SQL Server. It ensures data integrity, efficient query execution, and a user-friendly interface.

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed normalized relational schemas (publisher, books, categories, members, users, transactions).
- Implemented SQL-based CRUD operations for user registration, borrowing/returning books, and subscription handling.
- Incorporated user authentication and role-based permissions, reflecting realistic enterprise requirements.
